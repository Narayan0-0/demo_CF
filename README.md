# 💻 CFML First Project: Name Submission Form

Welcome to my first ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) project! This is a basic web form application where users can enter their name and submit it. Once submitted, the server processes and displays a greeting using CFML.

## 🚀 Features

* Clean and simple HTML form
* Dynamic response using CFML
* Demonstrates ColdFusion form handling
* Organized structure using `.cfm` and `Application.cfc`

## 🧾 Project Structure

```bash
📁 CFML-First-Project/
├── Application.cfc     # ColdFusion application configuration
├── index.cfm           # HTML form to collect user name
├── submit.cfm          # Processes and displays submitted name
```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. `index.cfm`: Displays the welcome message and the input form.
2. User enters a name and clicks **Submit**.
3. The form submits data to `submit.cfm`.
4. `submit.cfm` retrieves the submitted data and dynamically displays a personalized greeting.
